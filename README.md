# Case-study-E-H
This case study is inspired by real-life needs expressed by a company selling products and looking for stock optimization.

Through this exercise, we will answer 3 questions to help company E+H improve its stock management:
  - Write a script that proposes the top 3 products to put on stock and explain your reasoning
  - Do you see alternative solutions?
  - What are the main challenges you see for this business case and how would you mitigate them?
